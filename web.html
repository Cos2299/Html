        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the
        use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

        </h3>
        <p>
            Python was conceived in the late 1980s[42] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the
            Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[43] capable of exception
            handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[13] Its implementation began in December 1989.[44] Van Rossum
            shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his
            "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community
            bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[45] In January 2019, active
            Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.
